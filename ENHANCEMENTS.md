# Enhanced Features Implementation

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the basic backup system.

## 1. File Encryption

- **Implementation**: Files are encrypted using the `cryptography.fernet` module
- **Location**: `enhanced_server.py`
- **Key Management**: Keys are stored in `encryption.key` file
- **Fallback**: Gracefully degrades if cryptography module is not available

## 2. File Deduplication

- **Implementation**: Files are hashed using SHA-256 to identify duplicates
- **Method**: Identical files are stored once and hard-linked when duplicates are detected
- **Memory Management**: Hashes are stored in memory for quick lookups
- **Location**: `enhanced_server.py`

## 3. Web Interface for File Management

- **Implementation**: Added `/files` endpoint with HTML file browser
- **Features**: Lists all files with size, timestamp, and download links
- **Security**: Protected with the same basic authentication as uploads
- **Location**: `enhanced_server.py` (do_GET method)

## 4. Resumable Uploads

- **Implementation**: Added chunked upload support in the enhanced Python client
- **Method**: Files are split into 1MB chunks and uploaded sequentially
- **Progress**: Real-time progress tracking and reporting
- **Integrity**: SHA-256 hash verification
- **Location**: `enhanced_client.py`

## Using Enhanced Features

1. Run the enhanced server:
   ```
   start_enhanced_server.bat
   ```

2. Use the enhanced client for resumable uploads:
   ```
   python client\enhanced_client.py http://localhost:8080 user password path/to/file --resumable
   ```

3. Access the file browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/files
   ```

4. Run a demonstration of all features:
   ```
   test_enhanced_features.bat
   ```

## Considerations and Limitations

- **Memory Usage**: File hashes are stored in memory, which may be an issue for very large numbers of files
- **Encryption Performance**: Adding encryption increases CPU usage during uploads and downloads
- **Resumable Uploads**: Currently only supported in the Python client, not the C++ client
- **Hard Links**: Deduplication using hard links requires the files to be on the same filesystem
